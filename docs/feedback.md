        <blockquote>
            <p>We were struggling trying to implement our own IOT infrastructure when
                Thingsboard suddenly appeared. Immediately we started testing and were
                amazed with the feature completeness, stability and ease of use of this
                great platform, although it was only in version 1.0 and had been
                released just days prior.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Our business needed some special features on the frontend and some major
                modifications on the backend but after exchanging a few emails it was
                clear that Thingsboard was the way to go. The necessary changes were
                implemented in a matter of a few weeks and the quality and thoroughness
                of the implementation far exceed our expectations. I've been working
                with OSS since the mid 1990s and know of it's many benefits but the
                quality of Thingsboard as well as the speed of development continues to
                impress me.</p>

            <p>Thingsboard is the new kid on the (IoT PaaS) block. Its designed by developers for developers
                with emphasis to end-customers, with promising features that do not existing on other open source
                IoT platforms yet. It's build on proven, no-bullshit enterprise open source technologies and has
                progressed very fast since it's public launch thanks to its committed kick-ass senior dev team.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>In my company, we are currently merging our current LoRaWAN and Big Data Analytics solutions
                with Thingsboard, to have both of best worlds, and so far we are very happy with the results.
                We look forward to see Thingsboard being established as a weapon of choice for various IoT use cases
                and from our end we will try to contribute as much possible to it's success.</p>

            <p>We are a Hong Kong startup doing Big Data processing and analysis. One of our projects is to build a cloud based IoT system 
                for big machines with hundreds of sensors. The protocol used for the communication is MQTT.</p>
            <p>The requirements for the cloud solution are that it got to be scalable, high performance and beautifully presented.</p>    
            <p>After a month of research, we found and selected Thingsboard. Thingsboard stood out as it is fully integrated and
                built from industrial strength components like Netty, Cassandra and Akka, which gave us the confidence that it can
                scale out and up. That is important as we donâ€™t want a system upgrade and migration if the system fails to scale out
                or gives a poor performance after production.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>We have talked to the chief developer Andrew and learnt the background of the team. This gives us the confidence that 
               the main developers are well knowledgeable on the IoT area, even we knew the fact that Thingsboard is 6 month old project.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Another thing we love Thingsboard is its user interface/dashboard and its widget library. We can build beautiful and
                professional IoT dashboard with drag and drop of the widgets. If you see the official demo, you must agree with me.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Before writing this testimony, I have just finished building the Thingsboard instance from the source with the help from Andrew. 
                We are looking forwards doing some customization and contributing to the project.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Thingsboard offers a secure, scalable IoT solution that, being Open Source, we can control.
                Having created our own Thingsboard instance, we have found it to be very customisable via widgets,
                the rule engine and the plugin system allowing it to be used in a variety of specialist situations.</p>
