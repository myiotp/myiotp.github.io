Thingsboard is an open-source IoT platform that enables rapid development, management and scaling of IoT projects.

With Thingsboard, you are able to:

 - Provision and control devices.
 - Collect and visualize data from devices.
 - Analyze device data and trigger alarms.
 - Deliver device data to other systems.
 - Enable use-case specific features using customizable rules and plugins.  

Our goal is to provide the out-of-the-box IoT cloud or on-premises solution that will enable server-side infrastructure for your IoT applications.

#### Thingsboard is:

* **scalable**: horizontally scalable platform, build using leading open-source technologies.
* **fault-tolerant**: no single-point-of-failure, every node in the cluster is identical.
* **robust and efficient**: single server node can handle tens or even hundreds thousands of devices depending on use-case. 
Thingsboard cluster can handle millions of devices.
* **customizable**: adding new functionality is easy with customizable widgets, rule engine and plugin system.
* **durable**: never lose your data.

See [Thingsboard Architecture](/docs/reference/architecture) for more details.

**Note** You can also connect **existing** devices to the platform using **[Thingsboard Gateway](/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/)**.
